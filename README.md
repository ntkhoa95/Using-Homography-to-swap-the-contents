  Using homography to swap the contents of two photo frames
</h3>

## Content
Program for reading a JPG image, calculating homography mapping matrices between two photo frames in "ArtGallery.JPG", swapping them, and generating a new fake iamge.

## About
- The source code of this project named "main_SVD.py"    (using SVD to get the homography matrix)
- The source code of this project named "main_opencv.py" (using opencv to get the homography matrix)
- All the results files in folder named "output"

## Requirement packages
- numpy, opencv-python, matplotlib
- To install required packages: "pip install numpy matplotlib opencv-python opencv-contrib-python"
